We propose the concept of an origami `string': a slender structure with a programmable trajectory. The string is composed of a number of elements that can be individually programed to achieve a specific folding pattern and curvature. The mechanism has a single degree of freedom, allowing it to be actuated from one end while maintaining precise positioning along the entire string length. The relationship between the fold pattern and string path is simulated and experimentally validated, and its application as a robotic gripper and a biomimetic hand is demonstrated.
