We developed and tested a soft bending actuator that combines casting techniques and additive manufacturing. We demonstrated flexibility in the process by varying the bladder material. We also showed the actuatorâ€™s resilience to damage by cutting and puncturing the exoskeleton prior to operation. Finally, we integrated the bending actuator into a three-finger gripper configuration and performed a gripping test for four different objects with various weights and shapes. Results show that the curvature and force obtained in these actuators are comparable to other proposed bending actuators with a faster and more adaptable fabrication process.
