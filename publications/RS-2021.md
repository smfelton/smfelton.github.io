We developed and tested a durometer constructed with soft materials. We performed experiments to investigate the sensorâ€™s material selection, repeatability, drift, probing speed, and calibration. We also integrated the sensor into a commercial soft robotic gripper and used it to measure the hardness of an orange. The orange would be damaged by a traditional durometer, but the soft durometer left no visible marks.
