We developed and tested an origami-inspired reconfigurable antenna. The proposed antenna can operate as a monopole or an inverted-L antenna by changing its configuration. Doing so changes its operational frequency, principal radiation mode, and directivity. Measurements show that the antenna is able to change its resonance frequency from 750 MHz to 920 MHz, equivalent to 22.6% frequency shift.
