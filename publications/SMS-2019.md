We developed actuated hinges based on the electrostatic zipper architecture. We built and tested three designs, and characterized their step response, torque, and repeatability. The results indicate that electrostatic zipper hinges are substantially faster than alternative self-folding actuators. They can be designed to produce large fold angles (over 100 degrees) and repeatable analog behavior.
