We developed and tested a chemo-mechatronic system that changes its geometry and electrical functionality in the presence of specific chemical signals. To accomplish this, we integrated a protein hydrogel with an aluminum substrate and flexible circuit in a low-profile laminate. To demonstrate the concept, we built and tested a sensor that lights an LED when actuated in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG).
