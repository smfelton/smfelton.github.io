We present self-folding origami that consist of shape memory composites activated with uniform heating in an oven. These composites are rapidly fabricated using inexpensive materials and tools. Four self-folding shapes are demonstrated: a cube, an icosahedron, a flower, and a Miura pattern; each of which is activated in an oven in less than 4 min. Self-sealing is also investigated using hot melt adhesive, and the resulting structures are found to bear up to twice the load of unsealed structures.
