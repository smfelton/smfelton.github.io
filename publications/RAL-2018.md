We developed a new method for origami transformation that uses dynamic behavior to change the mountain-valley fold pattern. We demonstrate that origami structures reliably change their dynamic behavior at a discrete switching frequency, and this frequency can be changed by varying the stiffness and mass of the mechanism. We demonstrate a three-fingered gripping mechanism with a single actuator that can transform between four nontrivial configurations.
