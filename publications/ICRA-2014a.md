We built off our [previous work on self-folding](/publications/SM-2013) to construct three types of self-folding sensors: a mechanical switch, a capacitive contact sensor, and a velocity sensor. We utilize specialized fold patterns to create cyclic mechanical linkages as well as additional composite layers such as magnetic sheets to build these sensors. We demonstrate the integration of two of these sensors, the switch and the contact sensor, into a self-folding lamp.
