We developed a technique for building origami-equivalent compliant mechanisms: mechanical devices that preserve the origami kinetics and kinematics while offering higher load-bearing capacity compared to the original origami structure. We offer an energy equivalence principle between the origami and the compliant mechanism. We validate the principle using experimental investigation for a square-twist origami pattern.
