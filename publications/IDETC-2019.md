We extend our previous work on [dynamic origami](/publications/PRL-2018) transformation by using a stacked-Miura cell as an impulse generator to drive transformation. We characterize the snap-through behavior of the cell and show how the cell can be coupled to the string to drive repeatable transformations between different configurations.
