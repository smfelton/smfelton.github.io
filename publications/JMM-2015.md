We continued our previous work on millimeter-scale self folding with shape memory composites. In this paper, we showed that self-folding can be activated by a global heat source for simultaneous folding, or by resistive heaters for sequential folding. It is capable of feature sizes ranging from 0.5 to 40 mm, and is compatible with multiple laminate compositions. We demonstrate the ability to produce complex structures and mechanisms by building two self-folding pieces: a model ship and a model bumblebee.
