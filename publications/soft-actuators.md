## Liquid Metal Marbles

![Fluid Flow](/images/soft-actuators1.gif){:style="float: right;margin-left: 10px;margin-top: 7px;width: 200px"}![Actuated Nub](/images/soft-actuators3.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;margin-top: 7px;width: 150px"}Liquid metal marbles are small drops of eutectic Gallium Indium (eGaIn) suspended in a liquid. They can be induced to move via magnetic field, chemical reaction, or and electrically-induced change in surface tension. Typically these interactions are used to move the metal and this has been used to create morphing antennas, among other things. ![Model](/images/soft-actuators2.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-left: 10px;margin-top: 7px;width: 200px"}However, we applied this same principle to move an electrolyte solution that surrounds the marble in a microfluidic channel. We demonstrated the ability to generate flow and pressure to actuate a soft `nub' under a microfluidic chamber. The power density of the unoptimized marble was low (\~ 200 mW/kg) but I believe there was lots of room for improvement through better choices in solution and microchannel design.

## Flexible Linear Motor

The outer stator consisted of several copper coils in series that generated a phased magnetic field, and the inner core consisted of several permanent magnets joined together with flexible joints to create a single, flexible core. We prototyped a design but found it to have very low power density (\~ 150 mW/kg), likely due to the friction between the coils and the magnetic core. It would also have been difficult to miniaturize.
